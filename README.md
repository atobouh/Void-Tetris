# 👁️ VOID TETRIS

> "GRAVITY: 1. YOU: 0."

**VOID TETRIS** is not a puzzle game; it is an endurance test. It features a hostile "Director AI" that triggers curses based on your performance, ranging from inverted controls to simulated hardware failure.

### 💀 Features
* **The Dirty Dozen:** 12 distinct curses including "Ping 999" (Input Lag), "Gaslight" (Color Swaps), and "Mosh Pit" (Strobe Lights).
* **Visual Degradation:** CRT scanlines, chromatic aberration, and "GPU Dying" particle effects using PixiJS.
* **Hostile UX:** The game insults you upon death and provides a "Certificate of Failure" screenshot.
* **Audio:** Sub-bass drone ambiance (110Hz sawtooth) and reactive industrial sound effects.

### ⚠️ Warning
Contains flashing lights and sudden loud noises. Not suitable for the faint of heart (or fragile keyboards).
